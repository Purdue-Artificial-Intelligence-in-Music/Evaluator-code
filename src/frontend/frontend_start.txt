need npx and npm

navigate to the UI folder of the frontend directory
    if use terminal and are in the evaluator-code directory, do cd src/frontend/UI

to get it to start up, run npx expo start

Will use localhost 8081. on a web browser go to http://localhost:8081

All work for UI so far is in src/frontend/UI/app/index.tsx
