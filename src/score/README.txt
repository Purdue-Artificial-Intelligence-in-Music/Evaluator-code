Setup.py just sets up Audio Input, Transcribed, and Analysis folders. The only input folder is the Audio Input, which is provided because it has the audio clips I have been using to test the code. Therefore, Setup.py should just make a Transcribed and Analysis folder in the same directory as the file

Within AudioTranscriber.py, put the name of the WAV file into the section of code that asks for the name of the WAV file.
